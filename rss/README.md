This is my custom RSS feed viewer that i made to teach myself python dictionaries.
it's incredibly bare bones, and isnt very good. you can't even mark stuff as read. but it works. 
if you're gonna use this, be sure to download all of the files in the rss folder, as they're all important. 
also i've added an extra field to each item in the OPML file, which is for ignoring types of feeds.
